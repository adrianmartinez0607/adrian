# Full hole data with tee, approach, and overall strategy
hole_data = {
    1: {"Par": 5, "Yardage": 469, "Tips": "**Tee Shot:** Favor the left side to open up the fairway. Avoid the trees on the right.\n\n**Approach:** Long hitters may go for it in two (~245 carry), but the safe play is to lay up to 114â€“146 yards, short of left bunkers.\n\n**Overall:** Play for position. A wedge into the two-tiered green gives a great birdie chance."},
    2: {"Par": 4, "Yardage": 382, "Tips": "**Tee Shot:** Aim just left of the lone pine on the right. That line gives a clear approach.\n\n**Approach:** Wind can affect this shot from ~110â€“130 yards. Green slopes back-to-front â€” do not go long.\n\n**Overall:** Controlled tee and smart club on approach = par or birdie."},
    3: {"Par": 3, "Yardage": 156, "Tips": "**Tee Shot:** Elevated tee makes it play shorter. Knock off 1 club in calm or tailwind conditions.\n\n**Green:** Wide but narrow front-to-back. Avoid the bunker short left.\n\n**Overall:** Safe play is center of green â€” par is a solid score."},
    4: {"Par": 4, "Yardage": 408, "Tips": "**Tee Shot:** Hit to the left-center of the sloped fairway. Avoid drifting right.\n\n**Approach:** Mid-iron uphill from 130â€“150 yds. Take extra club but donâ€™t overshoot â€” the green slopes back to front.\n\n**Overall:** Precision off the tee and a confident uphill iron will give you a look at birdie."},
    5: {"Par": 4, "Yardage": 369, "Tips": "**Tee Shot:** Dogleg left â€” aim at the left-center of fairway. Donâ€™t try to cut the corner.\n\n**Approach:** From ~150 yds, trust your club. Green shape and wind can make it tricky.\n\n**Overall:** Safe drive + smart club = great birdie hole."},
    6: {"Par": 4, "Yardage": 354, "Tips": "**Tee Shot:** Slight draw around the corner is ideal. 215 yds puts you in wedge range.\n\n**Approach:** Elevated green â€” go middle. Donâ€™t attack tricky pins.\n\n**Overall:** Play for a short pitch and leave below the hole."},
    7: {"Par": 5, "Yardage": 478, "Tips": "**Tee Shot:** Find the fairway. Favor the right-center to set up the second.\n\n**Second Shot:** Aggressive line requires 250+ carry over water. Lay up to ~110 is safer.\n\n**Overall:** Pick your battle. Layup route still leaves a wedge to a tight green."},
    8: {"Par": 3, "Yardage": 127, "Tips": "**Tee Shot:** Wind and pin position dictate everything. Bunker guards the right.\n\n**Green:** Sloped and narrow. Play center and spin it.\n\n**Overall:** Donâ€™t chase pins â€” center is always safe."},
    9: {"Par": 4, "Yardage": 377, "Tips": "**Tee Shot:** Slight dogleg right. Best line is right-center fairway.\n\n**Approach:** Downhill shot from 130â€“140 yds. Green is guarded, so land soft.\n\n**Overall:** Great scoring hole if you control trajectory on approach."},
    10: {"Par": 4, "Yardage": 389, "Tips": "**Tee Shot:** Use long iron or hybrid to right-center. Driver brings trouble.\n\n**Approach:** 120â€“140 yds to a tight, elevated green. Be mindful of bunkers.\n\n**Overall:** Play smart off the tee, commit on the uphill second."},
    11: {"Par": 4, "Yardage": 407, "Tips": "**Tee Shot:** Drop in elevation. Hit 3W or hybrid just right of fairway bunker.\n\n**Approach:** From 130â€“150 yds. Green has movement, so stay right.\n\n**Overall:** Let the tee ball run, then play a controlled second."},
    12: {"Par": 5, "Yardage": 458, "Tips": "**Tee Shot:** Favor a fade. Left miss is jail.\n\n**Second Shot:** Can go for it, but smart layup to 100â€“120 yds avoids all trouble.\n\n**Overall:** This is a birdie hole â€” but only if you avoid the bunkers short right."},
    13: {"Par": 3, "Yardage": 187, "Tips": "**Tee Shot:** Plays 1â€“3 clubs less downhill. Factor in wind.\n\n**Green:** Wide but shallow. Choose center regardless of pin.\n\n**Overall:** Commit to your club â€” this oneâ€™s all about distance."},
    14: {"Par": 4, "Yardage": 243, "Tips": "**Tee Shot:** Tight and short. Lay up to ~165 short of pine.\n\n**Approach:** Wedge over Trout Creek to shallow green. Tough pin positions.\n\n**Overall:** Smart tee shot + crisp wedge = par or better."},
    15: {"Par": 5, "Yardage": 541, "Tips": "**Tee Shot:** Drive to right-center. Lots of room long.\n\n**Second Shot:** Lay up left side, avoiding right hazard.\n\n**Approach:** Into a two-tiered green â€” must carry the front.\n\n**Overall:** A true 3-shot hole. Donâ€™t get greedy."},
    16: {"Par": 3, "Yardage": 161, "Tips": "**Tee Shot:** Usually into wind. Avoid short/right (water and bunker).\n\n**Green:** Plenty of space left. Middle is the safest spot.\n\n**Overall:** Play the wind â€” par is a win."},
    17: {"Par": 4, "Yardage": 412, "Tips": "**Tee Shot:** Elevated tee. Aim just right of pine â€” breeze helps.\n\n**Approach:** From 130â€“150 yds. Best angle is from right.\n\n**Overall:** Left side slopes hard â€” bail right if in doubt."},
    18: {"Par": 4, "Yardage": 293, "Tips": "**Tee Shot:** Hybrid or FW to left-center (~230). Avoid fairway bunkers.\n\n**Approach:** Uphill into 3-tiered green. Know your pin.\n\n**Overall:** Final test. Choose your tier wisely and take your par."}
